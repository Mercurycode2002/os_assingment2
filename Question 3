Question 3:
Part B: 
  Preemptive SJF has the smallest average time as well as the fastest completion time for short jobs. In our example,
  our assembly lines will be able to rapidly produce items with a short or moderate production time. This will, on average,
  decrease the production time of items with a longer production time. Thus significantly reducing the starvation period of the items with a longer production time.
  The coding is that each production line has its own ready queue, which means that each assembly line can pick the item with the shortest time. We can also have 
  a single ready queue for all the assembly lines as well as a load balancer to improve efficiency.
Part D: 
  //question was not clear
  the priority algorithm allows the doctor to priorotize patients with major and serious injuries. this may cause patients with a non lethal or non life threating 
  injuries to have wait for a longer period of time.
